<h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>

<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (<u>HTML</u>)</b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web <br>applications.</p>

<p>Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents<br>
    into multimedia web pages. <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
    <br>included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
<br>

<u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects<br>
such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create<br>
structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,<br>
quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as<br>
&lt; img / &gt; and &lt; input / &gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as  surround and<br>
    provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not<br>
display the <u>HTML</u> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

<h2>Markup</h2>

    HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),<br>
character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in<br>
pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example<br>
<img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening<br>
tags and closing tags).

<p>Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
<br>
<p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
    <xmp>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Hello world!</p>
</body>
</html>
</xmp>
</p>
